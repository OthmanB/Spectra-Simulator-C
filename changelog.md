# Version history #

### v1.1.0 ###
	* Bug Fix:
		- Removed system command that were copying .rot and .range files from a temporary directory to the data directory. This was a relic of the time when python3 was called to solve the ARMM
	* Addition:
		- In asymptotic_mm_freeDp_numaxspread_curvepmodes_v3, added the possibility to provide a frequency input file. Can be used to link the simulator with frequencies generated by a Stellar evolution code + oscillation code. The file must be placed in  Configurations/MixedModes_models. Its name must be 'star_params.theoretical'. An example of such a file is provided in that directory. Note that the syntax is strict and no change in the file structure (order of its inputs, number of comments, etc...) should be performed.
		Note also that this file will be used ONLY if the second line contains a 1
		Like this, for the first two lines:
		# use_nu_nl : 0 = false / 1 = true
		1	 
### v1.0.4-dev ###
	* Bug Fix:
		- Corrected a bug happening when reading the cfg file due to imporper syntax
	* Improvements:
		- Minimising the changes required to bump_DP.cpp amd solver_mm.cpp when migrating them from the standalone version: Only need to remove the omp section
		- Slight restructuration of the ARMM calls
	* Addition:
		- Introducing the Hfactor and the Wfactor in asymptotic models for the mixed modes: It allows to 'break' the assumption of (1) equipartition of energy (Hfactor>0) and (2) inertia scaling with the Width, ie not considering that the damping is purely due to the evanescent zone between cavity (Wfactor<1)
### v1.0.3-dev ###
	* Bug Fix:
		- Correcting eta in the *Hgauss model
		- The rescaling of HNR in the models 'generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_act_asym_a1ovGamma' , 'generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_a1a2a3asymovGamma', 'generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_Alm', 'generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_aj' was incorrect due to a wrong generalisation from the old IDL code. 
		The old code was considering a fix noise background of N=N0=1. The new implementation was supposed to instead keep the noise background
		profile of the reference star in the new artificial star. This was not performed as it was still considering N0=1. 
		The modification consist in replacing N0 by N(v)=local_noise 
		- The rescaling was made considering the absolute highest HNR. This implies that it was considering the HNRmax for the l=1 (due to higher visibility of that mode). Instead, it is better to use the HNRmax(l=0) for reference when defining the HNR. A change was made in that way.
		- Fix an issue with some infiles used as a template: The Cadence and Tobs was wrongly commented by #, which was leading to ignore the first l=0
		- Fix an issue with the names of the variables in the Combinations.txt file: Some parameters names could be sticked together
		
### v1.0.2-dev ###
	* Improvment: 
		- Adding the possibility to use a file for defining the common section. See explanations in the Configuration/common_modelfile directory

### v1.0.1-dev ###
	* Bug fixes and improvments:
		- generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_a1Alma3asymovGamma():
			* Renaming to generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_Alm()
			* Fixing error in the Alm computation + optimisation following the latest release of acoef_checks
			* Possibility to use of all of aj coefficient up to a6 
	* New model: generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_aj()
	* Improvments:
		- Grid approach now handles *Alm() model type
		- Grid approach now handles *aj() model type
		- Update of build_lorentzian.* to the latest version from the cpp and adding dependences. Large code-quality improvments

### v1.0.0-dev ###
	* Added functionalities:
		- Implement the new model generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_a1Alma3asymovGamma: Handling simulations with Activity effect on splittings using Alm() function
                - Adding the grid approach within this code: NOTE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME BUGS HERE
                - Adding new functionalities to the configuration file: 
                	* do_modelfiles : If set to 1, it will make a .model file adequate for the TAMCMC code
                	* limit_data_range: If set to 1, it will limit the data file to the range where there is modes +/- 2*Dnu. Can hugely save space for large simulations
                	NOTE: This functionality is only valid for "artificial_spectrum_a1Alma3"
                	
### v0.9.1 [100%] ###
	* Added functionalities:
		- Implement on generate_cfg_from_synthese_file_Wscaled_a1a2a3asymovGamma: Handling simulation for a2 coeficient and a3 considering polynomials O2 for those

		- Using bump_DP.cpp and solver_mm.cpp instead of their python counter parts
	* Bug Fix:
		- Bugs on the definition of np_min and np_max corrected
		- Bugs on the solver_mm that was not handling properly the second order polynomials for the p modes

### v0.8.97 (*Released on 21 April 2020*) ###
        * Improvments:
		- Adding nmax_star used value in .range files because the random control nmax_spread is not sufficient to determine the curvature of the p-modes for each models.
### v0.8.96 (*Released on 23 Jan 2020*) ###
	* Added functionalities:
		- Adding the possibility to generate multiple noise realisation for a single model (several .ascii files for a single .in file). The new control variable should appear in the main.cfg file and is called Nrealisation (see example configuration files)
	* Improvments:
		- Adding failsafes if negative frequencies are found for p modes

	* Added functionalities:
		- Adding Templates database for Heights
                         WARNING: A new line is required in the main.cfg to specify the template file. This line must be set to NONE if the model does not require templates
		- Allow random jumps between heights a templates population 

### v0.8.92 (*Released on 16 Jan 2020*) ###

		- Adding controls for Visibilities

### v0.8.91 ###
	* Bug Fix:
		- Crash of the code due to failure in the mixed mode solver when the second order curvature is too large

### v0.8.9 (*Released on 26 Dec 2019*) ###
	* Bug fix:
		[1] numax_spread improperly doubling the value of numax instead of just adding a %age of numax [SOLVED]
		[2] nmax_spread bug fix [SOLVED]
		[3] interpolation of height/width from the sun failing due to a forbiden extrapolation [SOLVED]
		[4] Incorrect numax_star inside bump_DP.width_height_MS_sun_rescaled() due to a typo between nmax_star and numax_star [SOLVED]
		[5] The model asymptotic_mm_freeDp_numaxspread_curvepmodes_v3 was not properly linked to the function of the same name into models_database.cpp [SOLVED]
		[6] Fix of Nmax issue: At high HNR, the fix number of generated modes can make the spectrum look 'cut' at high frequency. To solve this temporarily
		  I generate +2 radial order at high frequency (6 below numax, 8 above number) instead of having the same number of modes. The apparent issue is 
		  mostly due to the fact that high degree modes have extremely large FWHM, making them very visible.      [SOLVED]

	* Added functionalities:
		[1] on models with mixed modes, add second order effects on frequencies (curvature for p modes):
		 	D0 was a fix parameter while it should be a variable. Instead of sticking to D0, I implemented the second order effect on the
		  	asymptotic relation for p modes. Thus now, we have Eq. 22 from Mosser+2018 (https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2018/10/aa32777-18.pdf)
		  	encoded. This means that we have 2 new variable (+ 1 variable change for D0):
		  		- alpha_p : The curvature coefficient which should be around 0.076/nmax according to Mosser+2018, but it seems that 0.0076/nmax or 0.076/nmax^2 is more reasonable (typo in their paper?)
	  			- nmax_spread : The location of the inflexion point for the parabola is described by alpha_p * (np - nmax)^2 / 2. nmax is in principle given by 
	  			  				nmax_th= nu_max/Dnu - epsilon. But we don't necessarily want to strictly enforce that. Instead, nmax_spread allows you to depart from numax_th. The value is given in %
	  			- delta0l : The small separation. It relates to D0 and replaces it. The relationship is: delta0l=-l(l+1) D0 /Dnu
	  					    Note that the actual used parameter is delta0l_percent, defined in unit of l(l+1) because by definition:
	  					    delta0l = - l(l+1) delta0l_percent / 100.
	  		Modifications required for that implementation:
	  			[1] Changes in solver_mm.py: compatibility changes in the test functions, update of asympt_nu_p() and introduction of solve_mm_asymptotic_O2p() to 	handle second order effects. It introduced a new test function as well specifically for O2p tests test_asymptotic()  ===> [100%] [TESTED]

		  The envelope rotation and the envelope-to-core ratio are therefore two new variables in the main.cfg, that replaces the variable Teff (effective temperature) of asymptotic_mm_v1
		* new model: asymptotic_mm_v3. This generates a uniform population of rotation rate in the envelope and in the core considering a uniform population in both case
		  The envelope rotation and the core rotation are therefore two new variables in the main.cfg, that replaces the variable Teff (effective temperature) of asymptotic_mm_v1
