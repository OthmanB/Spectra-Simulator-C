Directory that contains 'star_params.theoretical', used to compute a stellar model of an evolved stars,
from frequencies, Dnu, DPl, q, alpha_g provided by the user in that file.
The expected format is:

# use_nu_nl : 0 = false, 1 = true
0
# Global frequency parameters
Dnu=[Value]
DPl=[Value]
q =[Value]
alpha_g=[Value]
# Frequencies l, nu_nl
[l]   [Value]
...
...
[l]   [Value]
