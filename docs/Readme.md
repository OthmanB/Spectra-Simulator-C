# Documentation

There are now two complementary documentation entry points:

1. **User guide (recommended for day-to-day usage)**
   - File: `docs/User_Guide.md`
   - Covers installation, build, command-line options, configuration files, output layout, and troubleshooting.

2. **Doxygen API documentation (recommended for code internals)**
   1. Install doxygen.
   2. From `docs/`, run: `doxygen Doxyfile`
   3. Open `docs/html/index.html` in your browser.

If you are new to the project, start with `User_Guide.md` and then use Doxygen when you need function-level details.
