# Template file used to compute the height and width profile of simulated stars. 
# The values of this table is rescaled by the code so to match numax_star, Dnu_star and epsilon_star
# The table was generated using fitted frequencies and Heights of the Subgiants and early Red Giants
# Using the Coupled Oscilator Model (COscM) on Kepler Q0-7 data on 2011. Better templates can certainly
# be made nowadays using latest Kepler data release, but these may offer already a good diversity of 
# Width and Height profiles for l=0 modes. Note that I did not extrapolate those at the edge so that 
# The code may crash when trying to interpolate (if numax_ref is too different from numax_star)
