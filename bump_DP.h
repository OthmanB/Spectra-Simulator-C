/*
# The main function that generate a set of parameters used to generate Lorentzian profiles FOR SIMULATIONS IN THE C++ SIMULATOR
# Assumptions: 
#     - The frequencies of l=0, l=2 and l=3 modes follow exactly the asymtptotic relation for the p mdoes
#	  - The frequencies of the l=1 modes follow exactly the asymptotitc relation for the mixed modes
#	  - Widths of l=0, 2, 3 modes are rescaled using the synthetic relation from Appourchaux+2014 applied to the solar profile
#	  - Widths of l=1 mixed modes are defined using the ksi function, scaled using l=0 modes. Thus l=0 modes fixes the upper
#		limit of the mode width
#	  - Heights of l=0 modes are rescaled using the measured heights of the solar modes
#	  - Heights of l=1 mixed modes are set based on equipartition of energy accounting for damping and excitation assuming no radiative pressure
#		GrosJean+201X showed that this was valid for not-too-evolved RGB and for SG.
#	  - Bolometric visibilities in height are assumed to be 1, 1.5, 0.5, 0.07 for l=0,1,2,3 respectively
#	  - Splitting is implemented in different ways... see the various models
# 	  Warning for widths and heights: if fmin/fmax is too large, you may have an error as an extrapolation 
#									  would be required, which I forbid by code. An fmin/fmax that englobes
#									  10 radial orders should not pose any issue.
# Input: 
#	Dnu_star: Large separation for the p modes
#   epsilon_star: phase offset term for the asymtptotic relation of the p modes
#   delta0l_star, alpha_p_star, nmax_star: Instead of D0_star, these parameters can be used to create 2nd order asymptotic p modes (see Mosser+2018, Eq.22) 
#   DPl_star: The period spacing for l=1 g modes 
#	alpha_star: The phase offset term for the asymptotic relation of the g modes
#   q_star: Coupling coeficient between p and g modes
#	fmin: Minimum frequency for the modes that should be included in the calculations
#   fmax: Maximum frequency for the modes that should be included in the calculations
# Outputs:
#	nu_lx: Frequencies of the l=x modes. x is between 0 and 3
#	nu_p_l1: Base p modes frequencies used to build the frequencies for the l=1 mixed modes
#	nu_g_l1: Base p modes frequencies used to build the frequencies for the l=1 mixed modes
#	width_lx: Widths of the l=x modes. x is between 0 and 3
#   height_lx: Heights of the l=x modes. x is between 0 and 3
